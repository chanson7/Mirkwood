This project is a prototype of a Server Authoritative dueling game made in Unity.  It is integrated with Steam.  In this project, I have attempted my own solution for Client side Prediction and Server Reconciliation of player movement.  As of today, Unity has created their own solution within the Entity Component System.  I am now attempting to recreate this project in ECS.
